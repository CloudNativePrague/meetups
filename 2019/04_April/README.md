# Cloud Native Prague Meetup #2
Come join the Cloud Native Meetup in Prague and hang out with other Cloud enthusiasts. Share experiences, inspiration, discuss successes and fuck-ups. The event will take place at HubHub (Na Příkopě 14).

## Agenda:

### 17:50 - Open doors

### 18:00 - 18:45 - How to do SRE when you're not Google
(Vítek Urbanec, SRE grown-up at Unity Technologies, Finland)

Everyone knows the famous book about how SREs at Google work - but what if you're not Google? Dev & Ops teams everywhere are more or less successfully trying to make sense of Site Reliability Engineering - and often end up frustrated by the mess they cause by imitating the Google method.

Let’s have a look at what an SRE does in a normal non-Google company, discuss the fails and wins, check out some of the SRE projects we have done - and discover the “Zen of Reliability”.

Vítek likes being a grown-up about things, loves playing guitar and responsibly enjoys very hoppy beers. At Unity, he helps some super smart people figure out how to build more reliable services so the independent game devs can get paid for their games. He also leads the Helsinki office devmetal band.

### 18:50 - 19:05 - Lightning talk: Serverless in Kiwi.com
(Tomáš Papež, Migration Squad Lead @Kiwi.com)

I will share our journey and use cases in serverless world. From Lambda to Function and beyond.

Tomas is responsible for Kiwi migration to GCP. He loves everything cloud related and pushing technology to the limit. In personal life he’s just Adrenaline junkie and travel lover. 

### 19:10 - 19:55 - Connecting Microservices with Istio
(Peter Malina, CTO @FlowUp)

We've come a long way from monolithic architectures. However, instead of maintaining bulks of code, everybody ended up maintaining large distributed systems. Peter will first explain what challenges need to be addressed in such systems and how Istio helps to do so. He will then continue with an example of a sample distributed system and its configuration.

Peter considers himself to be a technological pioneer and an automation enthusiast. He creates technological solutions and leads their implementation at FlowUp.

### 20:00 - 21:00 (or later) - Networking and drinks
