# Cloud Native Prague Meetup #1
Come join the first Cloud Native Meetup in Prague and hang out with other Cloud enthusiasts. Share experiences, inspiration, discuss successes and fuck-ups. The first event will take place at HubHub (Na Příkopě 14).

## Agenda:

### 17:30 - Open doors

### 18:00 - 18:45 - Using Prometheus Histograms & Grafana Heatmaps
(Štefan Šafár, Content delivery network engineer at Showmax)

Histograms are a neat feature of Prometheus that offer a range of possibilities. Stefan will go through a few of the interesting things you can do with Prometheus, as well as the most-common pitfalls that you’ll want to avoid. He’ll also go into detail about how to display your results effectively using heatmaps in Grafana.

Stefan likes security, monitoring and cloud native software. At Showmax, he helps the CDN team do in-depth monitoring so they can spot bottlenecks and deliver more content faster.

### 18:50 - 19:05 - Lightning talk: Why look for something else when
there is Kubernetes?
(Anton Vorobiev, Infrastructure Tech Lead at Showmax and swiss army knife at Vorobiev.Cloud)

Anton will share their experience on modernizing container orchestration in Showmax: the dilemma of "which way to go?" aka the torment of making a decision; reasons why they've chosen /*spoiler*/ Hashicorp's Nomad over all the others. What challenges they had to solve and how it is compared with our beloved Kubernetes.

Anton is a huge fan of all that cloud stuff. In Showmax he helps ops team to make infrastructure more flexible and durable.

### 19:10 - 19:55 - Kubernetes on AWS - Kops
(Radek Los, SW Engineer at Liftago)

Liftago is the only app on the market that gives passenger the freedom of choose from offers from licensed taxi drivers and for such as service is crucial to be highly available. To reach this goal and focus more on smarter offers for passengers we use Kops to configure our production environment. Kops helps you to create, destroy, upgrade and maintain production-grade, highly available, Kubernetes clusters from the command line. I will present how we run Kubernestes self healing / multi AZ / HA cluster on AWS EC2 instances without any ops but only with small team of Java developers and how developers actually struggle to run their code on production environment.

### 20:00 - 21:00 (or later) - Networking and drinks
