# Cloud Native Prague Meetup #2
Come join the Cloud Native Meetup in Prague and hang out with other Cloud enthusiasts. Share experiences, inspiration, discuss successes and fuck-ups. The event will take place at HubHub (Na Příkopě 14).

## Agenda:

### 17:50 - Open doors

### 18:00 - 18:45 - Tailor-made Kubernetes using dynamic Admission Controllers
(Anton Vorobiev, Infrastructure Tech Lead at Showmax and swiss army knife at Vorobiev.Cloud)

Anton will guide you through the security model of Kubernetes focusing on often ignored functionalities such as Admission Controllers. He will prove just how powerful and flexible this concept is. Using a coding demo he will present how Admission Controllers can be utilised in the implementation of multi-tenant cluster or to achieve compliance with your company's security requirements.

Anton is a huge enthusiast of Cloud technologies and has a wide expertise in building and operating Kubernetes-based platforms. Being a Tech Lead at Showmax, he helps their Ops team manage their infrastructure and make it more flexible and durable.

### 18:50 - 19:05 - Lightning talk: On the road to 10k deployments per day
(Jakub Kadlubiec, Software Engineer at Skyscanner)

In the age of cloud native microservices and DevOps, it is more important than ever for companies to invest into central teams whose sole purpose is making other engineers in the company more productive. In this talk, Jakub will explain why Skyscanner believes that in order to stay competitive, they need to be able to deploy 10k times per day, and what is the central Developer Productivity team doing to achieve that.

Jakub is a software engineer at Skyscanner working on internal tools that make other engineers more productive. He started working at the company 3 years ago as an Engineering Manager in the London office. Now he’s back in the Czech Republic working remotely as an individual contributor.

### 19:10 - 19:55 - Google App Engine on real examples (Matchmaking and Leaderboards)
(Erik Ferencz, Google Cloud Developer/ Cloud Team lead in MADFINGER Games & Petr Matoušek, Google Cloud Developer in MADFINGER Games)

On the real examples of our two services, leaderboards and matchmaking we will show you the options Google AppEngine provides for IS development. We will go through several development stages of these services and present the list of technologies we used (such as AppEngine, DataStore, Redis, Kubernetes...) and API changes that allowed us to deliver and support our games with more value and less cost (operational / computational / storage costs). We will discuss the reasons why we use these approaches and the benefits they bring us.

Erik has more than 10 years of experience with backend development and is keen to deliver best solutions for great games and information systems.

Petr is the lead Google Cloud Platform developer at MADFINGER Games with more than 6 years of game development experience and enormous knowledge about GCP and cloud development.

MADFINGER Games is a lead studio in Free to Play games that delivers AAA experience into your mobile devices.
